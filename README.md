# SMR
Software tool to implement Mendelian randomisation based on summary statistics.

This software tool extends the [SMR tool 1.03](https://cnsgenomics.com/software/smr/) forked from [jianyangqt](https://github.com/jianyangqt) and developed by Futao Zhang with support from Zhili Zheng, Zhihong Zhu, Ting Qi, Yang Wu, and Jian Yang. This tool allows to calculate the effect size of gene expression on complex traits using eQTLs as instruments in a Mendelian randomisation approach. 

Additional functions compared to the original SMR tool include a multi-SNP analysis that calculates an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) estimate.
